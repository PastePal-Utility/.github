## About PastePal
PastePal is a feature-rich clipboard enhancement tool designed for power users who need more than just a simple history. It acts as a permanent, searchable memory for everything you copy, ensuring you never lose an important piece of information again. Beyond recall, its core strength lies in automation—transforming static clipboard data into dynamic, reusable tools. The snippet system with text expansion is a major time-saver for developers, writers, and support staff, turning short codes into paragraphs of text, code blocks, or formatted templates.

The application is built for efficiency and deep integration. It supports fuzzy search to quickly find historical items, allows for organizing snippets into folders, and can sync your clipboard database across Macs via iCloud. For advanced users, it offers tools to clean up copied text (removing line breaks, formatting), encode/decode strings, and calculate expressions copied from text. By combining robust history management with proactive automation features, PastePal goes from being a utility you check occasionally to an active partner in your daily workflow, reducing keystrokes and mouse clicks significantly.
